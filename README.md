# Facebook Page Negative Review Watchdog → Slack Escalation + Supabase Ticket

This workflow automatically monitors Facebook Page reviews, detects negative feedback (≤ 2 stars), alerts the support team via Slack and attempts to create a support record in Supabase with built-in error handling.

This workflow listens for Facebook Page reviews through a webhook. When a review with a rating of **2 stars or less** is received, the workflow prepares and standardizes the incoming data, sends an immediate Slack alert to the support team and attempts to store the review as a support record in Supabase. If the database operation fails, a fallback Slack alert is triggered with the relevant error details.

You receive:

- **Instant Slack alerts for negative Facebook reviews.**
- **Centralized data preparation via a global configuration step.**
- **Automated support record creation.**
- **Error visibility if storage fails.**
- **No manual monitoring of Facebook reviews.**

Ideal for customer support teams that want immediate visibility and structured tracking of negative customer feedback.

## Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Import the provided **n8n workflow JSON**.
2. Configure the **Facebook Page Review Trigger** webhook URL in your Facebook integration.
3. Review and adjust the **Global Configuration** node to match your incoming payload structure.
4. Connect your **Slack credentials** and select the channel for alerts.
5. Connect your **Supabase credentials** and configure the table used for storage.
6. Activate the workflow — monitoring starts instantly.

## What It Does

This workflow automates negative review handling:

1. Receives Facebook Page review data via a webhook.
2. Prepares and standardizes key review fields using a global configuration step.
3. Checks whether the review rating is **≤ 2 stars**.
4. Sends a formatted Slack alert to the support team with full review context.
5. Attempts to create a support record in Supabase.
6. Detects Supabase insert failures.
7. Sends a fallback Slack alert including the Supabase error message if record creation fails.

This ensures **no negative review is missed**, even if downstream storage encounters issues.

## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

- Customer support teams.
- Social media monitoring teams.
- SaaS companies handling public feedback.
- Operations teams needing visibility into failures.
- Product teams tracking user dissatisfaction.
- Any business receiving Facebook Page reviews.

## Requirements

- **Facebook Page review integration** (webhook-based)
- **Slack workspace** with API access
- **Supabase project** with insert permissions
- Basic understanding of JSON payloads and webhooks

## How It Works

1. **Facebook Page Review Trigger**  
   Receives new review data via POST webhook.

2. **Global Configuration**  
   Maps and standardizes incoming review fields such as rating, review text, reviewer name and page name for consistent downstream usage.

3. **Check Negative Review (≤ 2 Stars)**  
   Filters reviews and allows execution only for negative ratings.

4. **Slack – New Negative Review Alert**  
   Sends an immediate Slack notification with:

   - Page name
   - Reviewer name
   - Rating
   - Review text

5. **Create Support Case (Supabase)**  
   Attempts to store the review as a support record.

6. **Check Case Creation Failure**  
   Verifies whether the Supabase insert returned an error.

7. **Slack – Case Creation Failed Alert**  
   Sends a fallback Slack alert including review context and Supabase error details.

## Setup Steps

1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
2. Open **Facebook Page Review Trigger** and copy the webhook URL.
3. Configure your Facebook system to send review events to this webhook.
4. Review the **Global Configuration** node and update field mappings if needed.
5. Connect **Slack API credentials** and select the desired channel.
6. Connect **Supabase credentials** and configure the target table.
7. Save and activate the workflow.
